DailyDrive is a youth empowerment startup founded by Chance Jesca Bizima. It began as a response to the lack of motivation, structure, and routine I noticed in students' lives. DailyDrive offers tools like a Smart Alarm, Focused Planner, and a chatbot named DailyBot to help users build daily habits. 

Mission: Empower people to rebuild their lives through intentional habits and structured routines.

Vision: A world where anyone can take control of their habits, time, and mindset.

Team includes: Chance Jesca Bizima (Product Lead), Ishimwe Eric (UX Designer), and Lucky Prince (Community Manager).
